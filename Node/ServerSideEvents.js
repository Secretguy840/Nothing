/**
 * Server-Sent Events (SSE) is a technology that enables unidirectional communication from a server to a client over an HTTP connection. 
 * Unlike traditional methods like polling, where the client constantly asks the server for updates, 
 * SSE allows the server to push updates to the client automatically.
